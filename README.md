# cosmo_cloud_assignment

A new Flutter project given by cosmo cloud which is an Employee App.

## Getting Started

In this employee application, I created a simple CRUD app where users can view a list of employees and add new employees to the system. The app integrates with a MongoDB Cloud database via a custom-built Employee CRUD API, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete employee records. The user interface includes a floating action button for adding new employees, a delete button for removing employees, and an edit button for updating employee information.
